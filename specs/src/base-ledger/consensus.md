# Consensus

Namada uses [Tendermint Go](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) through the [tendermint-rs](https://github.com/heliaxdev/tendermint-rs) bindings in order to provide peer-to-peer transaction gossip, BFT consensus, and state machine replication for Namada's custom state machine. Tendermint Go implements the Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm, which you can read more about [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938).
