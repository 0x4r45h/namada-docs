# Public Goods Stewards Documentation
The funding of public goods on Namada is conducted through an entity called the "public goods stewards". Each public goods steward is a [multisignature account](./users/multisignature.mdx).

Each steward is elected by governance through separate governance proposals. 

See the specs about the public goods funding [here](https://specs.namada.net/economics/public-goods-funding.html) for more details.
