# The Namada SDK

The Namada software development kit (SDK) can be found in the `namada` repo under the path [`namada/shared`](https://github.com/anoma/namada/tree/main/shared). The SDK is written in Rust and can be used to interact with the Namada blockchain, by constructing transactions, signing them, and submitting them to the network.

## Quick Start

A good starting point to see the SDK in use is to check-out the [namada interface](https://github.com/anoma/namada-interface/tree/main/packages/shared/lib/src/sdk) repo. This repo contains a simple web application that uses the SDK to interact with the Namada blockchain. However, it is important to note the added complexity arising from the application integrating javascript using [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/), which is not necesary.

## Installation

The Namada SDK can be installed by creating a new Rust project and adding the following to the `Cargo.toml` file:

Once the sdk is installed, you can use it to interact with the Namada blockchain.
