# The PoW Solution on Namada

In order to combat the "costlessness of blockspace" problem with a testnet, and hence prevent DOS attacks as a result, when a Namada account does not have the required fees to pay for a transaction, the user must complete a Proof of Work challenge. The difficulty of this challenge is a parameter set by governance, and will dictate the (average) computational expenditure needed in order to complete the challenge.

<Callout type="warning">
Note that this current fix will be not be included in Mainnet as it is circumstantial to testnet.
</Callout>

In order to avoid having to complete endless Proof of Work challenges, we recommend using the faucet to fund the implicit account as one of a user's first transactions:

```shell copy
namada client transfer \
  --source faucet \
  --target keysha \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 1000 \
  --signer keysha
```
which will allow the key with alias `keysha` to sign future transactions and pay for any further fees.


# The PoW Faucet

The Faucet on Namada will always require users to complete a PoW challenge, regardless of the balance of the implicit account.
