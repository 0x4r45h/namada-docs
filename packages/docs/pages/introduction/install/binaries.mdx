# Install From Binaries

## Pre-requisites
There are certain pre-requisites that need to be installed before installing Namada via binaries. 

These are: 
- [CometBFT](./binaries/prerequisites.mdx#installing-cometbft)
- [GLIBC](./binaries/prerequisites.mdx#installing-glibc)

## Downloading the binaries

Now that you have all dependencies installed, you can download the latest binary release from our [releases page](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) by choosing the appropriate architecture.

The below code will download all the binaries for the latest release for all supported operating systems.
```shell copy
OPERATING_SYSTEM="Linux" # or "Darwin" for MacOS
latest_release_url=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/anoma/namada/releases/latest" | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d '"' -f 4 | grep "$OPERATING_SYSTEM")
wget "$latest_release_url"

# Unzip the downloaded file, The file name may vary depending on the version you've downloaded.
tar -xzvf namada-v0.25.0-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

## Placing the binaries onto `$PATH`
For ubuntu and mac machines, the following command should work for placing namada into path.

Once inside the directory containing the binaries:
```bash copy
sudo cp ./namada* /usr/local/bin/
```
