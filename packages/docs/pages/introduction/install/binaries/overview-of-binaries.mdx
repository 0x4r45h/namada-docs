# Overview of Binaries

Once installed, you should have the following binaries:

- `namada`: The main binary that can be used to interact with all the components of Namada
- `namadan`: The ledger node
- `namadac`: The client
- `namadaw`: The wallet

The main binary `namada` has sub-commands for all of the other binaries:

- `namada client == namadac`
- `namada node   == namadan`
- `namada wallet == namadaw`

To explore the command-line interface, add `--help` argument at any sub-command level to find out any possible sub-commands and/or arguments.


The binaries should be added to `$PATH` from the `make install` command. 
However, if this for some reason did not work, a solution may be to copy the binaries 
from `namada/target/release` to `$HOME/.local/bin/` for example: 

```shell copy 
cp namada/target/release/namada* $HOME/.local/bin/
```
