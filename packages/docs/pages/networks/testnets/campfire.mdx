# The Campfire Testnet

<Callout type="info">
The campfire testnet is a testnet that is run in parallel to the "validator" testnet. This is a community run testnet, currently being maintained and orchestrated by [Knowable](https://knowable.vc/) and the Luminara community. The version may differ from the validator testnet, and is currently running on version `v0.23.0`.

</Callout>

### Pre-requisites

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗">
Currently, campfire only supports Ubuntu machines in its current setup. 
</Callout>

The user will need to have installed the [Stack-Orchestrator](https://github.com/vknowable/stack-orchestrator), which is a general tool for quickly launching and managing a stack of Tendermint based blockchains. The docs are found in the [README](https://github.com/vknowable/stack-orchestrator/README.md) of the repo, and the tool can be installed by running the following command:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/vknowable/stack-orchestrator.git
cd stack-orchestrator
scripts/namada-quick-install.sh
exit
```

Once this is completed, it is recommended to install Namada through the following Docker image:

```bash copy
export NAMADA_TAG=v0.23.0
docker pull spork666/namada:$NAMADA_TAG
docker image tag spork666/namada:$NAMADA_TAG cerc/namada:local
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/namada
```

### Running the node

Once this is completed, the user can run the following command to start the node:

```bash copy
curl -o ~/luminara.env https://testnet.luminara.icu/luminara.env
laconic-so --stack public-namada deploy --env-file ~/luminara.env up
echo "export CONTAINER=$(docker ps -q)" | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
CONTAINER=$(docker ps -q)
```

The relevant and more detailed docs are found [here](https://knowabl.notion.site/From-scratch-to-syncing-in-10-minutes-c0a56b34cdec447fbe2a5cd8f559f0bb).

## Interacting with the testnet

The Luminara community has also composed a [Namada CLI cheat sheet](https://www.notion.so/Namada-CLI-cheat-sheet-b54b220610bd4e7e91548e32d7ac3c8a) that is available and useful for any Namada user.
