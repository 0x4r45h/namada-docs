# The Namada Ledger

To start a local Namada ledger node, run:

```shell copy
namada ledger
```

<Callout>
**Note**: You must have [joined a network](./introduction/quick-start.md) before you start the ledger. It throws an error if no network has been configured.

The node will attempt to connect to the persistent validator nodes and other peers in the network, and synchronize to the latest block.

By default, the ledger will store its configuration and state in your [base directory](./introduction/base-directory.md). 
You can use the `--base-dir` CLI global argument or `BASE_DIR` environment variable to change it.
</Callout>

Assuming you do not have a custom base_dir, you can export the BASE_DIR environment variable as follows:

```shell copy
export BASE_DIR=$(namadac utils default-base-dir)
```

The ledger also needs access to the built WASM files that are used in the genesis block. These files are included in release and shouldn't be modified, otherwise your node will fail with a consensus error on the genesis block. By default, these are expected to be in the `wasm` directory inside the chain directory that's in the base directory. This can also be set with the `--wasm-dir` CLI global argument, `NAMADA_WASM_DIR` environment variable or the configuration file.

The ledger configuration is stored in `$BASE_DIR/{chain_id}/config.toml` (with
default `--base-dir`). It is created when you join the network. You can modify
that file to change the configuration of your node. All values can also be set
via environment variables. 

Names of the recognized environment variables are
derived from the configuration keys by: uppercase every letter of the key,
insert `.` or `__` for each nested value and prepend `NAMADA_`. For example,
option `p2p_pex` in `[ledger.cometbft]` can be set by
```shell copy
NAMADA_LEDGER__COMETBFT__P2P_PEX=true # or false, depending on your heart's desires
``` 
or
```shell copy
NAMADA_LEDGER.COMETBFT.P2P_PEX=true # or false, depending on your heart's desires
``` 
in the environment 

<Callout>
**Note**: 

Only the double underscore form can be 
used in Bash, because Bash doesn't allow dots in
environment variable names
</Callout>
