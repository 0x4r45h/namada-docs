# Fees on Namada

In order to settle the market for Namada blockspace demand, fees are coupled with transactions. In order for any namada transaction to be considered valid, the correct corresponding fee must be paid. The exact fee is set by governance, and included in the genesis file under `gas_cost`.

## How fees are paid
When explicitly stated, the gas fee is paid by the `--gas-payer` flag. If no `--gas-payer` flag is specified, the gas fee is paid by the first key in the `--signing-keys` flag.

This means that in the transaction 
```shell copy
namada client transfer \
  --source my-new-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha
```

the account associated with key `keysha` will be required to pay the fee. This means that even though the account `accountant` may have a positive NAM balance, `keysha` will need to have the associated NAM in order to pay the transaction fee.

A user can also specify a `--gas-payer` flag to specify a different account to pay the fee. This is useful in cases where the account that is signing the transaction does not have enough NAM to pay the fee. For example, if `keysha` has a balance of 5 NAM, but `accountant` has a balance of 100 NAM, then the following transaction will be valid:

```shell copy
namada client transfer \
  --source my-new-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha \
  --gas-payer keysha2
  ```

(Assuming that `keysha2` exists and is in the wallet of the user)

For testnet purposes, we recommend [using the faucet](../networks/testnets/pow.md) to source NAM for transaction fees.

## How fees are calculated
The fee for a transaction is calculated by multiplying `gas-limit` by the gas price.
Both the `--gas-limit` and the `--gas-price` can be specified by the user. If neither is specified, the default gas limit and minimum gas price is used. The default gas limit for the transfer tx type, for example, is 20000.

The minimum gas price is set in the genesis file under `gas_cost`.

## How to set the gas price and gas limit

It is recommended to set the `gas-limit` based on the transaction being conducted. In order to estimate the `gas-limit` for a particular transaction, the `--dry-run` argument should be provided. This means that the transaction is simulated, but not yet sent to the ledger. 

For example, the following command will simulate a transfer transaction, and return the gas used:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-new-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha \
  --gas-payer keysha2 \
  --dry-run
```

Which will ouptut something along the lines of 

```md
Dry-run result: Transaction is valid. Gas used: 1785;
```
This means that we could reasonably make this transfer transaction with a `gas-limit` of 2000.

Hence, when making the transfer, we could specify the `gas-limit` as follows:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-new-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha \
  --gas-payer keysha2 \
  --gas-limit 2000
```

If for some reason, we wanted to pay a higher gas fee, we could also specify that as follows:

```shell copy
namadac transfer \
  --source my-new-acc \
  --target validator-1 \
  --token NAM \
  --amount 10 \
  --signing-keys keysha \
  --gas-payer keysha2 \
  --gas-limit 2000 \
  --gas-price 0.01
```
This will incentivise validators to prioritise this transaction above those with a lower gas price.
