# Background
A shielded transaction is a transaction in which recipient, sender and transaction amount are hidden from any external
observer. Sapling is a protocol that allows to two parties to execute a shielded transaction. It was developed by Electric
Coin Company and it constitutes a cornerstone piece of Zcash.

To achieve shielded transaction, sapling moves away from Bitcoin's UTXO model. It does so by introducing Notes, which carry value.
A value *v* represented in a Note is spendable by who holds the *spending key*. In Sapling input and output of what would be
a UTXO transaction are modified by containing commitments to notes, instead of addresses. From the *spending key* is possible
to derive a *viewing key*, which allows third parties and token owners to view transactions. To guarantee that a commitment to
a note have not been spent yet, when using a note as an input users have to publish a *nullifier*.
The collection of all shielded transaction is sometimes referred as **Shielded pool**.

Modern day block chain architectures allow for assets of different types to be exchanged. The Multi Asset Shielded Pool
is a protocol that allows for assets different types to be exchanged in a shielded fashion within one blockchain platform. This
is archived by introducing changes to the sapling protocol that allows to keep the asset type private.
