# MASP validity predicate (VP)

The MASP can be an Namada established account with a validity predicate which handles the verification of shielded
transactions.
Similarly to zcash, the asset balance of the shielded pool itself is transparent - that is, from the transparent
perspective, the MASP is just an account holding assets.

The MASP VP has the following functions:

- Accepts only valid transactions involving assets moving in or out of the pool.
- Accepts valid shielded-to-shielded transactions, which don't move assets from the perspective of transparent Namada¹.
- Publishes the note commitment and nullifier² reveal Merkle trees.

To make this possible, the host environment¹ needs to provide verification primitives to VPs. One possibility is to
provide a single high-level operation to verify transaction output descriptions² and proofs, but another is to provide
cryptographic functions in the host environment and implement the verifier as part of the VP.
1. what is the host environment?
2. why are we using the word "descriptions" here? What is it? Which one are we of the two are we going to unpack?

In future¹, the shielded pool will be able to update the note commitment and nullifier Merkle trees as it receives
transactions. This could likely be achieved via the temporary storage mechanism added for IBC, with the trees finalized
with each block.

The input to the VP is the following set of state changes:

- updates to the shielded pool's asset balances
- new encrypted notes¹
- updated note and nullifier tree states (partial, because we only have
  the last block's anchor)
1. What will there be in the encrypted notes? It woul be nice if it was better specified

and¹ the following data which is ancillary from the ledger's perspective:

- spend descriptions, which destroy old notes:
```
struct SpendDescription {
  // Value commitment to amount of the asset in the note being spent
  cv: jubjub::ExtendedPoint,
  // Last block's commitment tree root
  anchor: bls12_381::Scalar,
  // Nullifier for the note being nullified
  nullifier: [u8; 32],
  // Re-randomized version of the spend authorization key
  rk: PublicKey,
  // Spend authorization signature
  spend_auth_sig: Signature,
  // Zero-knowledge proof of the note and proof-authorizing key
  zkproof: Proof<Bls12>,
}
```
1. It says "and", but which ones of the bullet points above is actually described in SpendDescription ?
- output descriptions, which create new notes:
```
struct OutputDescription {
  // Value commitment to amount of the asset in the note being created
  cv: jubjub::ExtendedPoint,
  // Derived commitment tree location for the output note
  cmu: bls12_381::Scalar,
  // Note encryption public key
  epk: jubjub::ExtendedPoint,
  // Encrypted note ciphertext
  c_enc: [u8; ENC_CIPHERTEXT_SIZE],
  // Encrypted note key recovery ciphertext
  c_out: [u8; OUT_CIPHERTEXT_SIZE],
  // Zero-knowledge proof of the new encrypted note's location
  zkproof: Proof<Bls12>,
}
```

Given these inputs:

The VP must verify the proofs for all spend and output descriptions
([`bellman::groth16`](https://docs.rs/bellman/latest/bellman/groth16/index.html)), as well as the signature for spend notes.

Encrypted notes from output descriptions must be published in the storage so that holders of the viewing key can view them;
however, the VP does not concern itself with plaintext notes.

Nullifiers and commitments must be appended to their respective Merkle trees in the VP's storage as well, which is a
transaction-level rather than a block-level state update.
Is this something that happens after the VP verifies the proofs?

In addition to the individual spend and output description verifications, the final transparent asset value change
described in the transaction must equal the pool asset value change. As an additional sanity check, the pool's balance
of any asset may not end up negative.

NB: Shielded-to-shielded transactions in an asset do not, from the ledger's perspective, transact in that asset;
therefore, the asset's own VP cannot run as described above because the shielded pool is asset-hiding.
This is unclear to me. We state above that there is a final transparent asset value change, but at the same time in
Shielded-to-shielded case transactions do not transact. How can that be possible?

## Client capabilities
The client should be able to:
* Make transactions with a shielded sender and/or receiver
* Scan the blockchain to determine shielded assets in one's possession
* Generate payment addresses from viewing keys from spending keys
Viewing keys and spending keys were not introduced. When are they generated?

To make shielded transactions, the client has to be capable of creating and spending notes, and generating proofs which
the pool VP verifies.

Unlike the VP, which must have the ability to do complex verifications, the transaction code for shielded transactions
can be comparatively simple: it delivers the transparent value changes in or out of the pool, if any, and proof data
computed offline by the client.

Why would be the proving is comparatively simple respect to the verification? Does proof data = proofs of transactions?

The client and wallet must be extended to support the shielded pool¹ and the cryptographic operations needed to interact
with it. From the perspective of the transparent Namada protocol, a shielded transaction is just a data write to the
MASP² storage, unless it moves value in or out of the pool. The client needs the capability to create notes, transactions,
and proofs of transactions, but it has the advantage of simply being able to link against the MASP crates³, unlike the VP.
1. Shielded pool or MASP?
2. MASP or shielded pool?
3. This sentence is not cleat to me

## Protocol

### Note Format
The note structure encodes an asset's type, its quantity and its owner. More precisely, it has the following format:
```
struct Note {
  // Diversifier for recipient address
  d: jubjub::SubgroupPoint,
  // Diversified public transmission key for recipient address
  pk_d: jubjub::SubgroupPoint,
  // Asset value in the note
  value: u64,
  // Pedersen commitment trapdoor
  rseed: Rseed,
  // Asset identifier for this note
  asset_type: AssetType,
  // Arbitrary data chosen by note sender
  memo: [u8; 512],
}
```
For cryptographic details and further information, see
[Note Plaintexts and Memo Fields](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#noteptconcept).
Note that this structure is required only by the client; the VP only handles commitments to this data.

Diversifiers are selected by the client and used to diversify addresses and their associated keys. `v` and `t` identify
the asset type and value. Asset identifiers are derived from asset names, which are arbitrary strings (in this case,
token/other asset VP addresses). The derivation must deterministically result in an identifier which hashes to a valid
curve point.

### Transaction Format
The transaction data structure comprises a list of transparent inputs and outputs as well as a list of shielded inputs
and outputs. More precisely:
```
struct Transaction {
    // Transaction version
    version: u32,
    // Transparent inputs
    tx_in: Vec<TxIn>,
    // Transparent outputs
    tx_out: Vec<TxOut>,
    // The net value of Sapling spends minus outputs
    value_balance_sapling: Vec<(u64, AssetType)>,
    // A sequence ofSpend descriptions
    spends_sapling: Vec<SpendDescription>,
    // A sequence ofOutput descriptions
    outputs_sapling: Vec<OutputDescription>,
    // A binding signature on the SIGHASH transaction hash,
    binding_sig_sapling: [u8; 64],
}
```
It would be nice to have described how the list of shielded inputs and outputs is represented in this struct

For the cryptographic constraints and further information, see
[Transaction Encoding and Consensus](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#txnencoding).
Note that this structure slightly deviates from Sapling due to the fact that `value_balance_sapling` needs to be provided
for each asset type.

### Transparent Input Format
The input data structure decribes how much of each asset is being deducted from certain accounts. More precisely, it is
as follows:
```
struct TxIn {
    // Source address
    address: Address,
    // Asset identifier for this input
    token: AssetType,
    // Asset value in the input
    amount: u64,
    // A signature over the hash of the transaction
    sig: Signature,
    // Used to verify the owner's signature
    pk: PublicKey,
}
```
Note that the signature and public key are required to authenticate the deductions.
### Transparent Output Format
The output data structure decribes how much is being added to certain accounts. More precisely, it is as follows:
```
struct TxOut {
    // Destination address
    address: Address,
    // Asset identifier for this output
    token: AssetType,
    // Asset value in the output
    amount: u64,
}
```
Note that in contrast to Sapling's UTXO based approach, our transparent inputs/outputs are based on the account model used
in the rest of Namada.
