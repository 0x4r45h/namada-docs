## Multi-asset shielded pool

The multi-asset shielded pool (MASP) is an extension to the Sapling circuit which adds support for sending arbitrary assets.
Here we are going to showcase how it is integrated in Namada.

For detailed specification about the MASP itself, see [Cryptographic specification](https://github.com/anoma/masp/blob/main/docs/multi-asset-shielded-pool.pdf).
