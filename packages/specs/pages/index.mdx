# Namada

### Abstract

{/* Make privacy practical */}
Privacy should be default and inherent in the systems we use for transacting, yet safe and user-friendly multi-asset privacy doesn't yet exist in the blockchain ecosystem.
Up until now, users have had the choice of either a sovereign chain that reissues assets (e.g. [Zcash](https://z.cash/))
or a privacy preserving solution built on an existing smart contract chain (e.g. Tornado Cash). Both have large trade-offs: in the former case, users don't have assets that they actually want to transact with, and in the latter case, the restrictions of existing platforms mean that users leak (non-trivial) metadata, and the protocols may be expensive and clunky to use.
{/* Is this true in other solution like Aztec? */}
{/* Can we be more precise with "expensive and clunky to use"? */}
{/* How does Namada do it differently? Maybe we can introduce the Namada philosophy of "one click button", i.e. click one button to do many steps: unshielding, swapping on osmosis, shielding */}

Namada supports any fungible or non-fungible asset on an IBC-compatible blockchain
as well as fungible or non-fungible assets sent over a custom Ethereum bridge (such as ERC20 tokens and ERC721 tokens, respectively). Once assets are on Namada, shielded transfers are cheap and all assets contribute to the same anonymity set.

Users on Namada earn rewards, retain privacy of assets, and contribute to shared privacy.

## What is Namada?

Namada is a sovereign proof-of-stake blockchain, using the [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com/) (nee Tendermint) BFT consensus algorithm. Namada enables multi-asset private transfers for any native or non-native asset using a [multi-asset shielded pool](https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool/)(MASP) derived from the [Sapling circuit](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/).

Namada features full IBC protocol support, a natively integrated [Ethereum bridge](./interoperability.mdx), a modern [proof-of-stake system](./economics/proof-of-stake.mdx) with automatic reward compounding and cubic slashing, a [stake-weighted governance signalling mechanism](./governance.mdx), and a dual continuous/retroactive [public goods funding system](./economics/public-goods-funding.mdx).
{/* Link to cubic slashing? */}
{/* I would add a few words with the motivation for having each of these features */}

Users of the MASP are [rewarded](./economics/shielded-pool-incentives.mdx) for their contributions to the privacy set in the form of native protocol tokens (NAM). 

Namada supports a variety of different wallets. One of these wallets is the native wallet, that exists in order to facilitate interacting with the protocol in a safe and private manner. 
{/* Why different wallets? */}

Further, Namada supports Shielded Actions, which allows users to hold their assets privately on Namada most of the time while occasionally unshielding specific assets in order to interact with existing applications on transparent chains.
{/* Link to shielded actions? */}
