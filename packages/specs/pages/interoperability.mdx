## Interoperability

Namada is designed for trust-minimized interoperation with both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems:
- To the Ethereum ecosystem (Ethereum main chain and any rollups bridged to it), Namada connects using a bespoke [Ethereum bridge](./interoperability/ethereum-bridge.md) operated by the Namada validator set.
- To the Cosmos ecosystem (any chain which supports IBC), Namada connects using an [integration of the IBC protocol](./interoperability/ibc.md).
