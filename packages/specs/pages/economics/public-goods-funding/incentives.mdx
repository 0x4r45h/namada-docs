# PGF stewards incentives

Being a PGF steward is (should be) hard work. Stewards must invest their time in crafting proposals, being in touch with the opinions of the Namada community, and taking the risks associated with being voted out. 
In order to incentivise this effort, Namada allocates a set amount of NAM inflation that is directed towards the stewards.

This inflation is allocated towards the PGF internal address, in which each steward account has control over their respective share of the funds.
The inflation is "streamed" to the PGF internal address, in an identical manner to how the cPGF is streamed to the recipients (i.e end of each epoch).
The Steward account can then unilaterally (within the rules of a multisig transaction) either:
    - Set up a "stream of income" to another account (e.g a personal account)
    - Transfer collected funds in a lump sum transaction

The parameter of inflation income is set by governance and is included in genesis by default. 
That allocation is then allocated to each steward (more stewards = more total funding).
