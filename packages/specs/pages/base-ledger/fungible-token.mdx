# Fungible token

{/* TODO: Unfamiliar with this VP, should be looked at */}

The fungible token validity predicate authorises token balance changes on the basis of conservation-of-supply and approval-by-sender. Namada implements a "multitoken" validity predicate, in that all tokens have the same logic and can share one VP (with appropriate storage distinctions).
{/* Suggestion: Explain how the address of a token vp is derived from both storage and logic */}

A token balance is stored with a storage key. The token balance key should be `#Multitoken/{token_addr}/balance/{owner_addr}`. These keys can be made with [token functions](https://github.com/anoma/namada/blob/5da82f093f10c0381865accba99f60c557360c51/core/src/types/token.rs).

We can have multitoken balances for the same owner by `{token_addr}`, e.g. a token received over IBC is managed in `#Multitoken/{ibc_token}/balance/{receiver_addr}`. It is distinguished from the receiver's original balance in `#Multitoken/{token_addr}/balance/{receiver_addr}` to know which chain the token was transferred from. The `{ibc_token}` is explained in [IBC](../interoperability/ibc.md).

Transfers between the balances with the same `{token_addr}` are allowed. Specifically, we can transfer a token from `#Multitoken/{token_addr}/balance/{sender_addr}` to `#Multitoken/{token_addr}/balance/{receiver_addr}`.
{/* Can a user transfer from ibc_token to token_addr for the same token or these can never be the same token? */}

These balance changes are validated by the multitoken validity predicate. The multitoken validity predicate also checks whether the token is minted or burned. If a token is minted, i.e. when `#Multitoken/{token_addr}/balance/minted` is updated in the transaction, not only the total minted balance is checked but also the minter's validity predicate is checked. The minter should be set in a transaction minting the token. For example, when a token is received over IBC, the received token will be minted for the receiver's balance `#Multitoken/{ibc_token}/balance/{receiver_addr}`. The minted balance `#Multitoken/{ibc_token}/balance/minted` is also increased by the amount of the received token. The minted amount should be checked by the multitoken validity predicate. And, the multitoken validity predicate checks if the minter's validity predicate, the IBC validity predicate in this case, will be called (IBC validity predicate checks the minted amount is correct for the corresponding IBC operation).
{/* This paragraph is a bit confusing to me. E.g. "The minter should be set in a transaction minting the token." */}
