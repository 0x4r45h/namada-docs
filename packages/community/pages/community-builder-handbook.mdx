## Joining the Namada Community Builders
Namada Community Builders are individuals who are aligned with Namada’s [mission and vision](https://namada.net/vision). They actively collaborate to support and grow the Namada community.

To become a Community Builder:
1. Join the Namada [Discord](http://discord.gg/namada) and verify yourself
2. Part of this process will ask you to sign up for [Coordinape](http://coordinape.com).
3. You can sign up with an email or an ETH address. 
    - It is up to you to decide how you add an address, but please note - this address will not receive funds, it will only be used to authenticate your access to Coordinape.
4. Fill out the Namada Community Builder [Form](https://namada.deform.cc/communitybuilders):
    - Paste your Coordinape ETH address into the Community Builder form.
    - Finish filling out the form on DeForm and hit 'submit'.
5. Once you have filled out this form, an early community Steward will review your application and offer you the 'Community Builder' role on Discord, giving you an orange account badge.
6. This will give you access to several channels on the server listed below for Onboarding.

## Onboarding
If you’re selected to join the Community Builders, an existing member of the CB will reach out and you will be onboarded to the coordination platforms:

1. On the Namada Discord Server:
    - You’ll be assigned the “Community Builder” role 
    - You’ll also be invited to the following channels: 
        - `#cb-onboarding`
        - `#cb-jamming`
        - `#cb-contributions`
        - `#cb-help`
    - Once you’re in, you’ll need to get up-to-speed by:
        - Introducing yourself to the other Community Builders
        - Reading all pinned messages and linked resources
2. On Coordinape:
    - You’ll be invited to join the Namada Community Builder circle 
    - Get yourself familiar with the platform

## Contributing

### Contribution Guidelines

**Content Relevance:** 
Ensure your submissions align with Namada's values and mission, with a focus on its commitment to privacy and blockchain utility.

**Avoid Price Speculation:** 
Discussions involving cryptocurrency pricing or 'moon' references are not permitted. The focus should be on the impact and value proposition of Namada's technology, not on financial gains.

**Diverse Content Formats Accepted:**
Your contributions can be in the form of written work, podcasts, videos, or visual art. Choose the format that best conveys your message and utilizes your skills.

**Maintain Factual Accuracy:**
Maintain the integrity of your content by ensuring it is factually accurate. Ask other contributors, such as CB members, for fact-checking or review!

**No Length Restrictions, but Quality is Key:**
Contributions can be of any length, provided they are insightful and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

## Tracking Contributions
Using Coordinape, Community Builders can publicly document and look at their and other builders’ contributions. Make sure you keep track of all your contributions. 

When adding your contribution to Coordinape, please include the following information:
1. Link to contribution (must be accessible publicly)
2. What? Describe the nature of your contribution
3. Why? Describe the impact of your contribution
4. Who? Describe who helped and how
5. What’s next? Suggest how someone could continue this work

Once the contribution has been added to Coordinape, share the link to your contribution in `#cb-contributions`. If you are a Community Builder who would like to discuss another CB member’s contributions, do so in a thread attached to the message that they have posted in Discord.
