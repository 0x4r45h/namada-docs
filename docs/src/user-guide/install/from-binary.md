# Install From Binaries

```admonish warning
Prebuilt binaries might not be available for a specific release or architecture, in this case you have to [build from source](./from-source.md).
```

## Downloading the binaries

Now that you have all dependencies installed, you can download the latest binary release from our [releases page](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) by choosing the appropriate architecture.

## Placing the binaries onto `$PATH`
For ubuntu and mac machines, the following command should work for placing namada into path

Once inside the directory containing the binaries:
```bash
sudo cp ./namada* /usr/local/bin/
```
