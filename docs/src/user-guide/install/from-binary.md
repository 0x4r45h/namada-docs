# From Binaries

```admonish warning
Prebuilt binaries might not be available for a specific release or architecture, in this case you have to [build from source](#from-source).
```

## Installing Tendermint

Namada binaries require a unique fork of Tendermint from Heliax. Please follow [these instructions](./installing-tendermint.md).

## Installing GLIBC

Finally, you should have GLIBC `v2.29` or higher.

**MacOS**: the system-provided glibc should be recent enough.

**Ubuntu 20.04**: this is installed by default and you don't have to do anything more.

**Ubuntu 18.04**: glibc has `v2.27` by default which is lower than the required version to run Namada. We recommend to directly [install from source](#from-source) or upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04, instead of updating glibc to the required version, since the latter way can be a messy and tedious task. In case, updating glibc would interest you this [website](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/9.0-systemd/chapter05/glibc.html) gives you the steps to build the package from source.

## Downloading the binaries

Now that you have all dependencies installed, you can download the latest binary release from our [releases page](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases) by choosing the appropriate architecture.

## Placing the binaries onto `$PATH`
For ubuntu and mac machines, the following command should work for placing namada into path

Once inside the directory containing the binaries:
```bash
sudo cp ./namada* /usr/local/bin/
```
